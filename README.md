Relief Node is a decentralized platform built on Base (Ethereum L2) that connects disaster relief efforts with blockchain technology. Our initial implementation includes:
iOS app with SwiftUI frontend that:
Enables wallet connection via Coinbase Wallet SDK
Displays list of verified charity organizations
Allows users to donate directly to charities using ETH
Features coin creation functionality for fundraising
Smart Contract Development:
Created ERC20 token template for fundraising
Deployed on Base Sepolia testnet
Enables transparent fund tracking
Key Features Implemented:
Secure wallet integration
Direct charity donations
Custom token creation
Real-time transaction tracking
The platform aims to make disaster relief more efficient and transparent while enabling creators to fundraise through custom tokens. Future development will focus on DeFi integration, cross-chain support, and enhanced governance features.
Current stage: MVP with basic wallet connection, token creation, and donation functionality on testnet.
