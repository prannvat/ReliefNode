Relief Node is a decentralized platform built on Base (Ethereum L2) that connects disaster relief efforts with blockchain technology. Our initial implementation includes:
iOS app with SwiftUI frontend that:
Enables wallet connection via Coinbase Wallet SDK
Displays list of verified charity organizations
Allows users to donate directly to charities using ETH
Features coin creation functionality for fundraising
Smart Contract Development:
Created ERC20 token template for fundraising
Deployed on Base Sepolia testnet
Enables transparent fund tracking
Key Features Implemented:
Secure wallet integration
Direct charity donations
Custom token creation
Real-time transaction tracking
The platform aims to make disaster relief more efficient and transparent while enabling creators to fundraise through custom tokens. Future development will focus on DeFi integration, cross-chain support, and enhanced governance features.
Current stage: MVP with basic wallet connection, token creation, and donation functionality on testnet.



Verified Charity Wallets:
Each charity gets a verified wallet address
We maintain a public registry of verified charity addresses
Similar to Twitter's blue check, but for charity wallets
Donors can see which addresses are officially verified
Transaction Tracking:
Wallets
- All transactions are public on Base/Ethereum blockchain
Anyone can view:
How much was received
Where funds were sent
When transactions occurred
Use Block Explorer (like Basescan) to track


Coin Fund raising: 
Think of it like a verified Instagram account, but more strict:
- Creator must provide:
  • Government ID
  • Proof of address
  • Social media verification
  • Phone number verification
  
Like opening a bank account, but for creating fundraisers.



Like a video game with levels:
Level 1: Raise $10,000 -> Get $2,000 released
Level 2: Show proof of work -> Get $3,000 released
Level 3: Complete project phase -> Get $5,000 released

Money isn't given all at once - it's released in stages based on progress.


Think of it like a savings account that only unlocks after time:
- Creator creates coin
- Creator gets 1,000,000 coins
- BUT they can only sell:
  • 20% after 6 months
  • 40% after 1 year
  • 40% after 2 years
  
Prevents "rug pulls" where creators dump all coins immediately.


Like a democracy for each project:
- People who buy coins get voting power
- They vote on:
  • Should next milestone payment be released?
  • Is project progressing well?
  • Should timeline be extended?
  
Similar to shareholders voting in a company.

Like a trusted middle-man:
1. Donors send money
2. Money held by smart contract (not creator)
3. Multiple trusted parties must approve withdrawal
4. Only released when conditions met

Example:
$100,000 raised
↓
Held in smart contract
↓
Creator needs:
- Community vote
- Project advisor approval
- Milestone completion
To withdraw funds

Like eBay seller ratings but for fundraisers:
• Past successful projects
• Total money raised
• Community ratings
• Verification level

Level 1: New creator (limited fundraising)
Level 2: One successful project
Level 3: Multiple successful projects
Level 4: Verified track record
